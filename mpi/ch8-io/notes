MPI imposes no requirements on I/O; left up to any given implementation.
All implementations allow at least one process access to stdout and stderr.
Not all, but many, give access to stdin.
We'll write some functions to organize I/O.

MPI provides "attribute caching" to store information which should be available to all
processes.
