euler : Solutions to Project Euler problems in Python and Fortran

=================================================================

I've been meaning to try out Project Euler problems for a while,
and I've finally decided to make the time to work through some of 
the problems. (Something to do while watching The Daily Show... 
:-)

I'm going to try to eventually do each of the solutions twice,
in Python and Fortran. Why these languages? Python is probably
my favorite language, I think most easily in it, but in my work
in HPC I've been encountering a LOT of Fortran. I wrote quite a
bit of Fortran in computational physics courses, but 
I'd like to get better at it, so working these a second time seems 
worthwhile. I might try to throw a few solutions in C as well, as
that's another language I want more practice in.
