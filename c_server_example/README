nweb is an extremely simple web server outlined in an 
IBM DeveloperWorks article by Nigel Griffiths. See
http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/systems/library/es-nweb/index.html.

I'm going to step through writing it (well, typing it) myself as an
intro to some simple C network programming. Committing it to a repo
on BitBucket for my own future reference.
