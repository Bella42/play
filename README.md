Play!
=====

This repo contains a lot of random play: bits of coding tutorials, 
exploratory programming to learn a new technique, incomplete stuff
that help me clarify my thinking, that kind of thing. *Not* a real
project of any sort, but part of the point of open source is sharing
our silly code as well as our polished projects.
