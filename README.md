Play!
=====

This repo contains a lot of random play: bits of coding tutorials, 
exploratory programming to learn a new technique, incomplete stuff
that help me clarify my thinking, that kind of thing. There's a lot
of junk in here, but part of the point of open source is sharing
our random code as well as our polished projects. :-)

For example, when I wanted to play with Python C-extensions or 
Fortran extensions, the simple example code I wrote ended up in this
repo. But the real work probably didn't.

The Euler directory contains some solutions to Project Euler problems,
mostly in Python or Fortran.
